#Boris Bikes#

London's Boris Bikes (well, 'Santander Cycles') are awesome. Anyone can hire out a bike and ride it around London.

Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, came to us with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They wanted us to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.
